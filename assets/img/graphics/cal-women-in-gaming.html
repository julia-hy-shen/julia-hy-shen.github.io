  <h5>BACKGROUND</h5>
  <p>Cal Women in Gaming (CWG) is a UC Berkeley-sponsored initiative dedicated to creating space for women and other people of underrepresented genders in the gaming community. CWG was founded in fall 2018 and is entirely student-run.

<p>I’ve been a part of CWG’s leadership team since it was founded. For 2019-2020, I was elected to serve as Co-president, along with Helen Yang. This page will focus on what I accomplished in the Co-president position.

        <h5>GOALS</h5>

        </ol>
        </div>

    <div id="column2a">
      <h5 id="blue">OUTCOMES</h5>

    <h5>CONTEXT</h5>
    <p> CWG’s primary operations are centered on hosting events for students to socialize and learn together. As Co-presidents, Helen and I led our officer board’s weekly meetings, where we would give feedback on the previous week’s events, propose new ideas, and prepare for upcoming projects. It was my responsibility to facilitate discussions and delegate tasks.

<p>For college organizations, it’s crucial to constantly build interest among younger students to ensure that once old leadership graduates, new leaders will be there to take their place. Since CWG is still very young, our user base was still fairly small at the start of 2019. Based on that, one of my primary goals was to grow our membership base to ensure that CWG will exist for years to come.

<p>Below is a <b>selection of the projects</b> I’ve led and been a part of at CWG.

        <h5 id="CWG"> SPRING SUMMIT</h5>
        <p>"Spring Summit" is an annual end-of-year event focused on women's empowerment, where CWG invites professionals in the gaming industry to speak on a panel and network with students. Previously, Spring Summit has featured guests representing companies such as Electronic Arts, NVIDIA, CORSAIR, Riot Games, Twitch, and Blizzard Entertainment.

    <p>COVID-19 struck as we approached the 2020 Spring Summit. As Co-presidents, Helen and I managed our transition to an online format, wrote out our panel questions, communicated the event format to our guest speakers, and oversaw our marketing schedule. On the day of the event, I served as the event host by moderating our seven-person panel, making announcements to our guests, and initiating transitions between different sections of the event.

    <h5 id="CWG">MENTORSHIP PROGRAM</h5>
    <p>The CWG one-on-one mentorship program matches gaming industry professionals with students at UC Berkeley. Each pairing meets at least once a month, with guided discussion topics provided by CWG officers.

<p>For the 2019-2020 program, I wrote our program launch material and acquired volunteer signups from 39 professionals in the video games industry, representing companies such as Twitch, Riot Games, CORSAIR, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, and NVIDIA.

            <p>The CWG Discord server is currently home to 158 users (up from ~50 in 2019), and receives hundreds of messages per day. I manage our rules, roles, server suggestions, and bots to ensure that our Discord community is a fun and safe place for our members.

<p>Above is a screenshot of the server rules, which I continuously revise as the server grows and our needs change. I also implemented our verification system, which requires new members to provide information in the #verify-yourself channel before they are granted access the rest of the server.

                <p> During my time as Co-president:

                  <ol>
                    <li><b>CWG hosted 44 events</b> (including socials, field trips, professional development workshops, and guest panels), <b>a 120% increase compared to the previous year.</b> As a result, CWG members had even more opportunities to build friendships and bond with other like-minded students.

<li><p><b>CWG’s membership numbers doubled, from 42 members in 2018-2019 to 87 members in 2019-2020.</b> (Membership is not retained year-to-year; we start with 0 members every fall.)

<li><p><b>CWG's total social media followers tripled.</b> We ended 2020 with 456 followers (across Facebook, Twitter and Discord), compared to 123 total followers at the end of 2019.

                  <h5>LESSONS LEARNED</h5>
                  <p>This was my first time being at the top of the leadership hierarchy in any organization. I learned to <b>trust myself and my experience</b> when I was serving as the final decision-maker on a project or giving advice to my team members.

<p>CWG is incredibly important to me, and it's been a joy to see it grow over the past two years. I'm super thankful for the <a href="https://twitter.com/CalWomenGaming/status/1258220691586867200?s=20" target="_blank">2019-2020 officer board</a> (especially Helen Yang, my fellow Co-president) and all the incredible womxn I've gotten to know through this club!
