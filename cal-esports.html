  <h5>BACKGROUND</h5>
  <p>Cal Esports is a UC Berkeley program that supports the Cal Esports Community Center (an on-campus  facility equipped with 50+ gaming PCs), competitive esports teams, and student community organizations. Cal Esports brought on an intern team for summer 2019 to solve some of the challenges they’d faced in their first year of operation.

    <h5>CONTEXT</h5>
    <p id="sub"><i>I was primarily responsible for the Cal Esports social media rebrand, so this page will focus on that project. If you'd like to read more about my contributions to the membership program, you can do that <b>here.</b></i></p>
<p>From its inception, Cal Esports was meant to keep casual and competitive gaming at Cal under one umbrella. The term “esports,” however, typically implies competitive gaming only, leading to confusion among students. One of Cal Esports’s goals for the summer was to make it clear that Cal Esports represents both community and competition, instead of just the latter.


<p><i>Limitations:</i> The internship period was very short, and interns were only allowed to work a maximum of 20 hours per week due to budget constraints. Overall, we had to complete a lot of tasks over a relatively brief period of time.
      </div>

      <div class="row1">
    <h5>RESEARCH</h5>
    <p>We kicked off our social media revamp by conducting <b>competitive analysis,</b> observing other scholastic gaming organizations such as <a id="underline" href="https://www.facebook.com/uciesports/" target="_blank">UCI Esports.</a> We also conducted <b>informal interviews</b> with members of the UC Berkeley gaming community to gain an understanding of what they thought of Cal Esports’s social media presence.</p>

<p>From our research, we learned that:
  <ol>
<li>The Cal Esports Facebook page <b>lacked complete information</b> about the brand’s purpose.
<li>Cal Esports’s <b>brand voice was significantly more formal</b> than that of competing brands.
<li>Students thought Cal Esports seemed disconnected from the on-campus community because their <b>posts often had nothing to do with Cal students.</b>
  </ol>

      </div>

      <div class="row1">
    <h5>SOLUTIONS</h5>
    <p>
      Based on our research, we established that our primary goals were to:<ol>
<li><b>Increase engagement</b> (Reactions, comments) on the Cal Esports Facebook page by implementing a friendlier, more modern brand voice and creating content tailored to Cal students' interests.
<li>Make the Cal Esports Facebook page an <b>all-inclusive hub of information,</b> allowing students to seamlessly access important information and links.
  </ol>

<p>In order to achieve these goals, I personally:
  <ol>
    <li> Designed a new cover photo, incorporating observations from competitive analysis in addition to feedback from co-interns and management.
    <li>Wrote new copy for the “About” and “Story” sections, reworking brand voice to be less formal.
    <li>Created a variety of different posts for the page.
    <li>Worked with student club leadership to make Cal Esports an admin in all student club Facebook groups, linking every group back to the Cal Esports page.
  </ol>

              <div class="row1">

                <h5 id="one">IMPACT</h5>
<p>While I was creating content for the Facebook page, <b>user engagement increased by 830%.</b> Posts designed and written by me received an average of 28 likes, while posts on the Cal Esports page averaged 3 likes during the months before the internship. The cover photo I designed remains the Cal Esports page’s <b>most-liked post ever</b> as of June 2020.
<p>Additionally, the redesigned Cal Esports Membership Program acquired <b>500 new users in the 2019-2020 school year,</b> making up 30% of its current user base.
                </div>

                <div class="row1">

                  <h5>REFLECTIONS</h5>
                  <p> This was my first time working for a large, corporate brand. As an official UC Berkeley program, Cal Esports must follow all of the school’s restrictions on how to use colors, logos, fonts, and more; I learned how to <b>adapt quickly to those guidelines</b> while creating exciting content.</p>

<p>Similarly, I learned a lot about communicating my ideas to an audience. Before this internship, I’d never experienced being part of a team that was frequently split between projects. Every Friday, we’d all come together to share what we’d been working on throughout the week, so I gained experience in <b>presenting my work concisely.</b>
