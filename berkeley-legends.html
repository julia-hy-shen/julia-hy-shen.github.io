  <h5>BACKGROUND</h5>
  <p><a id="underline" href="https://legends.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley Legends</a> (founded 2013) is UC Berkeley’s official, Riot Games-sponsored League of Legends club. The club hosts weekly events for the on-campus League of Legends community. I joined the executive board in September 2018 as the Membership Lead.


<p>I was responsible for <b>spearheading all Members-only events and overseeing the Berkeley Legends “family system.”</b> Additionally, I assisted with the club’s marketing efforts by creating event graphics, writing social media copy, and maintaining online community spaces (such as the club’s Discord server and Facebook groups.)

    <h5>CONTEXT</h5>
    <p>All Berkeley Legends events are open to everyone, but students who want to be more involved have the option of paying a fee to become a Berkeley Legends Member. Members gain access to our “family system” and are invited to special Members-only events.

<p>The Berkeley Legends family system divides Members into “families” of 10-15 students, each led by two executive board officers. Families meet up for socials every one to two weeks, allowing Members to hang out in smaller and less formal groups.

<p>As Membership Lead, I created the family signup system at the start of each semester and organized family-related events and challenges, in addition to Members-only social events.

<p>Below is a <b>selection of projects</b> that I worked on at Berkeley Legends.

        <h5 id="CWG">MEMBERS-ONLY EVENTS</h5>
        <p>Berkeley Legends Members tend to be the most dedicated, passionate people in our community, which makes putting together Members-only events extra important. I led pre-event logistics, such as RSVP forms and activity setup, and managed day-of operations for all of those events.

<p>Pictured above are the Family Fight Night and Member’s BBQ events, both from Spring 2019. Family Fight Night is a competition where the families play games to win points and earn the title of Fight Night champions. BBQ is a half-day event for our Members to socialize and enjoy some home-made food together. In the spring, it also functions as our senior send-off.

    <h5 id="CWG">COMPETITIVE TOURNAMENTS</h5>
    <p>Berkeley Legends hosts an ARAM tournament twice a year, and a 5v5 tournament once a year. ARAM is relatively casual; players sign up individually or with a duo, and in theory, anyone can win due to team balancing. 5v5 is much more competitive. Teams can only sign up as a premade squad of five, and there’s often hardcore practice and scouting involved.

<p>In preparation for the Spring 2019 ARAM tournament, I created a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xbwd9a0543vo7ez/Berkeley%20League%20of%20Legends%20Tournament%20Sponsorship%20Deck-compressed.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" id="underline">pitch deck</a> (containing tournament information, sponsorship benefits, and materials requests) to be sent to potential sponsors. Ultimately, we received $300 in computer peripheral prizing from CORSAIR for the event.

<p>I assisted with the marketing efforts for all three tournaments in 2018-2019. Each event attracted more than 50 student competitors.

                <p>During my time as an executive board member:

                  <ol>
                    <li><b>Berkeley Legends hosted a total of 29 different events,</b> including socials, LAN parties, esports viewing parties, and competitive gaming tournaments. I assisted in the planning, marketing, and execution of every event.

<li><b>Berkeley Legends acquired 94 participants in its paid membership program,</b> up from 46 in the previous year. I managed our Member-exclusive activities and programming.

<li><b>Berkeley Legends secured and distributed more than $1,400 in sponsored prizing</b> for gaming tournaments and other events. I designed the proposal decks that were used in communication with sponsors.

</ol>

                  <h5>REFLECTIONS</h5>
                  <p> It’s amazing to see how people's lives change as a direct result of your work, and that’s what I loved about Berkeley Legends. Many of our Members become close friends with each other; they form their own group chats, grab dinner outside of club activities, take classes together, and more, all because they met in the space we created. Seeing those friendships come to life is incredibly rewarding, and it makes me feel proud of the community that our executive board built.
