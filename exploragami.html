  <h5>BACKGROUND</h5>
  <p>This project was created for the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/college-activision-creative-jam-live-with-adobe-xd-registration-105032527116" target="_blank">Activision + Adobe College Creative Jam,</a> a design experience tournament that ran from May 29th to May 31st. The tournament’s design challenge was to <b>create a mobile app experience to inform new gamers about video games.</b> Participating teams had to use Adobe XD to create a working prototype of their solution within the two-day time limit.

<p>I signed up for the tournament with three friends from UC Berkeley: Julian, Amy, and Patrick. None of us had ever participated in a design challenge before, but we were all lifelong gamers. Our final app, “EXPLORAGAMI: Games Unfolded,” contains a variety of mini-games designed for children. The app <b>recommends video games to the user based on their in-app choices and playtime.</b>

    <h5>CONTEXT</h5>
    <p>Our task was to create an app that introduces users to video games and helps them find games that are right for them. (The full challenge brief is <a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:cf8f4e73-3942-4298-8894-3d1effe75557" target="_blank" id="underline">viewable here.</a>) The prompt also asked us to choose one of the target audiences they provided; we decided that <b>our app would be designed for young children (8+ years old) and their parents.</b>

<p>The competition began at 10:00 AM on Friday, May 29th, and submissions were due on Sunday, May 31st at 12:00 PM, so <b>we had a little more than two full days to create our prototype.</b>

      </div>

      <div class="row1">
        <h5 id="CWG">IDEATION</h5>
        <p>With a limited amount of time, we settled on our concept quickly. We wanted to create an app with a variety of mini-games, and <b>kids would receive personalized recommendations for video games based on the in-app mini-games they liked best.</b>

<p>For example, a cooking mini-game where you must make food to quickly fulfill customer orders requires time-management and multi-tasking skills. If a user played several levels of that mini-game, the app would recommend video games that require similar skills or have a similar, fast-paced feel.

<p>We wanted to stay away from a more traditional, quiz-type experience to give recommendations because we thought interacting with mini-games would be more fun and provide more relevant results. Additionally, going from not playing games at all to playing PC or console titles is a big leap; our mini-games would serve as the user’s stepping stone to more complex experiences.

<p>Lastly, we wanted to make sure that users would have plenty of opportunities to show off their discoveries to friends. We decided that the app’s home screen would be a customizable “room” where users could view, display, and share all their game recommendations and in-app collectibles.

<p id="CWG"><b>(Theoretical) game design!</b>
                  <p>We knew we wouldn’t have time to actually implement games for the app, but we wanted to have a few example games to show how EXPLORAGAMI works. We settled on three games that would appear in our final prototype:
                    <ol>
<li>A cooking game where you make different meals.
<br><b>Skills:</b> multi-tasking, time-management.
<li>An iSpy-type game where you find lost objects.
<br><b>Skills:</b> concentration, attention.
<li>A choose-your-own-adventure visual novel where you explore a nature reserve.
<br><b>Skill:</b> reading.

    <h5 id="CWG">WIREFRAMING</h5>
    <p>After listing out every single screen we would need, it was time to start wireframing! While Julian and Amy started sketching out some game character designs and background art, Patrick and I laid out all of our low-fidelity screens.

                <p>
                  With about half of our day gone, we started polishing our assets and bringing our design to life.

                  <p>For our final look, we thought a papercraft theme would be cute and appealing to kids, and the flat shapes would be (relatively) easy to create in a short period of time.

                  <p>In this phase, I wrote and edited all of our in-game copy. I also created the buttons throughout the UI and all of the assets for the “Trophy Case,” “Friends List,” “Message Board,” “Game Recs,” and “Settings” screens. Amy fully illustrated “My Room," designed our tutorial character (“Narra-Deer”), and created the look of our dialog boxes. Julian drew the rest of our animal friends and all of our mini-game screens. As a team, we all worked together to arrange our final assets.

                  <p>Our final prototype had 72 screens; here’s a selection of them.

                  <h5>REFLECTIONS</h5>
                  <p>No one on my team had ever participated in a design tournament before, and I was the only team member who had previously used Adobe XD. Despite our lack of experience, I think we created something awesome! <b>We had so much fun working together, and it felt amazing to build a prototype from start to finish in just two days.</b>

<p>We didn’t end up placing (or even scoring well) in the actual competition. I think our biggest mistake was <b>failing to understand the judge's expectations regarding prototype structure.</b> Every winning team included an onboarding tutorial that was completely linear, while our prototype basically just dumped the judges into our completed app design. If I participate in another Creative Jam, I’ll keep the winning formats in mind.

<p>That being said, <b>I’m super proud of my team’s idea and our execution, and designing this app together was a wonderful experience.</b> I loved putting my UI/UX design knowledge into practice, and we all got to brush up on our Adobe Photoshop and XD skills. We’ll be seeking out other opportunities to create together; I’m sure more of our work will appear on this website in the future!
