  <h5>BACKGROUND</h5>
  <p>This project was created for the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/college-activision-creative-jam-live-with-adobe-xd-registration-105032527116" target="_blank">Activision + Adobe College Creative Jam,</a> a design experience tournament that ran from May 29th to May 31st. The tournament’s design challenge was to <b>create a mobile app experience to inform new gamers about video games.</b> Participating teams had to use Adobe XD to create a working prototype of their solution within the 2-day time limit.

<p>I signed up for the tournament with three friends from UC Berkeley: Julian, Amy, and Patrick. None of us had ever participated in a design challenge before, but we were all lifelong gamers. Our final app, “EXPLORAGAMI: Games Unfolded,” contains a variety of mini-games designed for children. The app <b>recommends video games to the user based on their in-app choices and playtime.</b>

    <div class="project-body-txt">
      <div class="row1">
    <h5>CONTEXT</h5>
    <p>Our task was to create an app that introduces users to video games and helps them find games that are right for them. (The full challenge brief is <a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:cf8f4e73-3942-4298-8894-3d1effe75557" target="_blank" id="underline">viewable here.</a>) The prompt also asked us to choose one of the target audiences they provided; we decided that <b>our app would be designed for young children (8+ years old) and their parents.</b>

<p>The competition began at 10:00 AM on Friday, May 29th, and submissions were due on Sunday, May 31st at 12:00 PM, so <b>we had a little more than 2 full days to create our prototype.</b>

      </div>

      <div class="row1">
        <h5 id="CWG">IDEATION & DESIGN PILLARS</h5>
        <p>With a limited amount of time, we settled on our concept quickly. We wanted to create an app with a variety of mini-games, and <b>kids would receive personalized recommendations for video games based on the in-app mini-games they liked best.</b>

<p>For example, a cooking mini-game where you must make food to quickly fulfill customer orders requires time-management and multi-tasking skills. If a user played several levels of that mini-game, the app would recommend video games that require similar skills or have a similar, fast-paced feel.

<div id="blockquote">
  <div id="quote-txt">
      <p id="CWG">Our idea was based on <b>three design pillars:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <b><i><li>Familiar interactions</b></i>
    <br>We wanted our app to be <b>something that kids and their parents would gravitate towards.</b> So, we based the UI off of things that are common in kids' real lives, like a personal "room."
    <p>We also leaned on a lot of <b>existing design standards</b> to create our interaction patterns and finalize our visual style. For example, our level select process was heavily based on the UI of other mobile games (ex. Angry Birds level select) for ease of use and onboarding. Additionally, animal characters are very common in kids’ apps, so we thought using that type of visual would be attractive to our users.
<p>
    <i><b><li>Game-style progression</b></i>
    <br>From kids’ matching games to hardcore first-person shooters, all video games evolve as you play them. We thought that <b>an app designed to introduce kids to gaming should teach them <i>how</i> to play those games.</b>
    <p>So, we wanted to include something in this app that would <b>allow users to encounter progression towards new experiences.</b>
    <p>Based on that, we settled on the idea of using in-app mini-games to make console/PC game recommendations—our mini-games would serve as the user’s stepping stone to more complex experiences.

    <i><b><li>Feasibility in 2 days</b></i>
    <br>The tournament’s time limit was our biggest constraint. Determining our concept, laying out all screens and UX elements, and creating final polished visual assets within 2 days had a big impact on the look and features of our project.

<p id="CWG"><b>(Theoretical) game design!</b>
                  <p>We knew we wouldn’t have time to actually implement games for the app, but we wanted to have a few example games to show how EXPLORAGAMI works. We settled on three games that would appear in our final prototype:
                    <ol>
<li>A cooking game where you make different meals.
<br><b>Skills:</b> multi-tasking, time-management.
<li>An iSpy-type game where you find lost objects.
<br><b>Skills:</b> concentration, attention.
<li>A choose-your-own-adventure visual novel where you explore a nature reserve.
<br><b>Skills:</b> reading, personal accountability.
</ol>

      <div class="row1">
    <h5 id="CWG">WIREFRAMING & DESIGN CHANGES</h5>
    <p>After listing out every single screen we would need, it was time to start wireframing! While Julian and Amy started sketching out some game character designs and background art, Patrick and I laid out all of our low-fidelity screens.

<p> As we laid everything out, we realized that some of our original ideas would have to be changed based on our audience targeting goals and time constraints. <b>Below is a list of a few of ideas we had to cut or rework:</b>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Collectibles from external games</b></i>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
    <li>We originally wanted users to collect items based on games the app would recommend, like a Mario hat or a Kirby star. But we realized those things were only exciting to us because we are already gamers; we had to make the in-game collectibles appealing to our audience, not us.
      <li><b>Collectibles had to be based on what the app’s users would know,</b> i.e. the in-app minigames and their characters.
  </ul>
  <li><b><i>Chatting system</b></i>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
<li>We originally wanted to incorporate a chatting/customized mail system so users could interact with their friends. But again, we realized that this wouldn’t make the most sense for our target audience. Giving kids a channel to type whatever they wanted would cause additional worry for parents, and a full chat system wouldn’t serve a purpose in the app’s core goal of introducing kids to games.
<li>We ultimately <b>limited “mail” to three pre-written messages,</b> allowing kids to share games with friends and recommend them to each other while preventing them from sending custom text.
</ul>
<li><b><i>Game select user flow</b></i>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
<li>We originally wanted the entire app to take place within one “My Room” screen; the user would tap their on-screen computer to get to the game select.
<li>We realized that if we wanted to allow the app to recommend console games, this could get confusing since you can’t play some console games on PC! People who are new to gaming don't necessarily know that.
<li>We also <b>didn’t want to reinforce the idea that gaming = not interacting with others.</b>
<li>So, <b>we changed game select to going “outside.”</b> When the user plays mini-games in the app universe, they’re interacting with their animal friends and helping around the neighborhood.
</ul>
</ul>

                <h5 id="CWG">PROTOTYPING</h5>
                <p>
                  With about half of our day gone, we started polishing our assets and bringing our design to life.

                  <p>For our final look, we thought a papercraft theme would be cute and appealing to kids, and the flat shapes would be (relatively) easy to create in a short period of time.

                  <p>In this phase, <b>I wrote and edited all of our in-game copy.</b> I also <b>created the buttons throughout the UI</b> and all of the assets for the “Trophy Case,” “Friends List,” “Message Board,” “Game Recs,” and “Settings” screens. Amy fully illustrated “My Room," designed our tutorial character (“Narra-Deer”), and created the look of our dialog boxes. Julian drew the rest of our animal friends and all of our mini-game screens. As a team, we all worked together to arrange our final assets.

                  <p>Our final prototype had 72 screens; here’s a selection of them.

                  <h5>REFLECTIONS</h5>
                  <p>No one on my team had ever participated in a design tournament before, and I was the only team member who had previously used Adobe XD. Despite our lack of experience, I think we created something awesome! <b>We had so much fun working together, and it felt amazing to build a prototype from start to finish in just 2 days.</b>

<p>We didn’t end up placing (or even scoring well) in the actual competition. I think our biggest mistake was <b>failing to understand the judge's expectations regarding prototype structure.</b> Every winning team included an onboarding tutorial that was completely linear, while our prototype basically just dumped the judges into our completed app design. If I participate in another Creative Jam, I’ll keep the judge's user flow in mind.

<p>That being said, <b>I’m super proud of my team’s idea and our execution, and designing this app together was a wonderful experience.</b> I loved putting my UI/UX design knowledge into practice, and we all got to brush up on our Adobe Photoshop and XD skills. We’ll be seeking out other opportunities to create together; I’m sure more of our work will appear on this website in the future!
